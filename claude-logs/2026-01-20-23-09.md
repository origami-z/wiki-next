Phase 1 implementation is complete! I've successfully created all the project setup files:

## Created Files

1. **package.json** - Added all dependencies including Next.js 15, React 19, Base UI, next-intl, and next-themes
2. **next.config.ts** - Configured Next.js with the next-intl plugin integration
3. **tsconfig.json** - Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path aliases
4. **middleware.ts** - Implemented locale routing middleware with admin route blocking in production
5. **src/i18n/routing.ts** - Configured locale settings (en/zh) with 'as-needed' prefix strategy
6. **src/i18n/request.ts** - Set up request configuration for loading translation messages
7. **src/styles/themes/variables.css** - Created comprehensive CSS design tokens for light/dark themes

## Next Steps

To get started with the project:

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Create empty translation files at `messages/en.json` and `messages/zh.json` (will be populated in Phase 5)
3. Proceed with Phase 2: Layout & Components

The foundation is now in place with internationalization, theming support, and TypeScript configuration ready to go.
