I've updated the response-logger hook to include conversation duration at the end. The changes:

1. **Tracks timestamps** - The script now captures the first and last message timestamps from the transcript
2. **Calculates duration** - Converts timestamps to epoch seconds and calculates the difference
3. **Formats output** - Displays as "Xm Ys" for durations over a minute, or just "Xs" for shorter conversations
4. **Appends to log** - Adds a blank line followed by "✻ Baked for {duration}" at the end of each log file

The hook will now output logs like:
```
[assistant message content]

✻ Baked for 1m 34s
```

The script uses macOS-compatible `date -j` formatting for timestamp parsing (since you're on Darwin).

✻ Baked for 45s
