Phase 3: Data Layer has been successfully implemented! Here's what was created:

## Files Created

### 1. **TypeScript Interfaces** (`src/types/game.ts`)
   - Comprehensive type definitions for game metadata, entities, and data loading
   - Generic `GameEntity` interface for flexible multi-game support
   - Wittle Defender-specific types: `Hero`, `Dungeon`, `Skill`, `Mechanic`
   - Helper types for data loading and filtering

### 2. **Data Loader** (`src/lib/data/loader.ts`)
   - React cache-enabled functions for optimal server-side performance
   - Key functions:
     - `loadGameMeta()` - Load game metadata
     - `loadEntities()` - Load entity collections
     - `loadEntityBySlug()` - Load single entity
     - `loadGameData()` - Load complete game data
     - `searchEntities()` - Search functionality
     - `filterEntities()` - Custom filtering

### 3. **Game Metadata** (`src/data/games/wittle-defender/_meta.json`)
   - Defines 4 categories: Heroes, Dungeons, Skills, Mechanics
   - Display field configurations for each category
   - Relationship definitions between entities

### 4. **Sample Data Files**
   - **heroes.json**: 17 heroes with diverse rarities, elements, roles, and tiers
   - **dungeons.json**: 9 dungeons with various types, difficulties, and multi-stage progression
   - **skills.json**: 30 skills covering active, passive, and ultimate abilities

## Data Highlights

- **Heroes**: S-tier legendaries (Ember Knight, Thunder Striker, Solar Paladin), mythics (Shadow Reaper, Inferno Dragon), and a full range of rarities
- **Dungeons**: Story, challenge, event, and raid types with recommended heroes and rewards
- **Skills**: Elemental abilities (fire, ice, lightning, poison, holy, dark, nature) with various effects (damage, heal, buff, debuff, control)

All entities are interconnected with proper IDs, support the i18n structure defined in the plan, and are ready to be consumed by the application pages.
