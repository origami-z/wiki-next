I've created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for the repository. The file includes:

1. **Commands section**: All development, build, and testing commands with clear descriptions
2. **Architecture section**: Detailed explanations of the key architectural patterns:
   - Internationalization setup with next-intl (routing, request config, middleware)
   - Theming system with next-themes
   - Component organization structure
   - Layout structure
   - Path aliases

3. **Important implementation notes**: Critical details that require reading multiple files to understand:
   - Middleware location requirement (validated by tests)
   - Admin route protection logic
   - Base UI portal isolation requirement
   - Theme hydration handling

The file focuses on the "big picture" architecture and non-obvious implementation details that would help future Claude Code instances be productive quickly, without repeating basic development practices or listing every file.
