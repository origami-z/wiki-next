Done! I've updated CLAUDE.md to include a new "Git Commits" section in the Development Practices area. The guidance now states that changes from the `./claude-logs` folder should always be included when creating commits.

The change has been committed with the message: "Update CLAUDE.md to include claude-logs in commits"

Note: The claude-logs files are already tracked in git, so any future changes to them will be included in commits following this new guideline.
