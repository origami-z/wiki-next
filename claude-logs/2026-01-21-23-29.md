I've updated the CLAUDE.md file to include a new "Development Practices" section that emphasizes adding tests when fixing bugs. The guidance includes:

- Clear requirement to add tests for bug fixes
- When to use unit tests vs E2E tests
- The purpose (preventing regression)
- A concrete example from the existing codebase (`__tests__/middleware-location.test.ts`)

This will help future Claude Code instances understand that test coverage for bug fixes is a priority in this project.
