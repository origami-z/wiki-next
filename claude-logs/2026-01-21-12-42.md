Phase 2 implementation is complete! I've successfully created all the layout and component files:

## Created Files

**Phase 2: Layout & Components (8 files)**

1. **src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx** - Root layout with ThemeProvider, NextIntlClientProvider, Header, and Footer
2. **src/app/globals.css** - Global styles with CSS reset, Base UI portal setup, and utility classes
3. **src/components/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx** - Theme provider wrapper for next-themes with light/dark/system modes
4. **src/components/layout/Header/** - Responsive header with mobile hamburger menu, desktop navigation, theme toggle, and locale switch
5. **src/components/layout/Footer/** - Simple footer with copyright notice
6. **src/components/features/ThemeToggle/** - Three-way theme toggle button (light/dark/system)
7. **src/components/features/LocaleSwitch/** - Locale switcher button (EN/中)
8. **src/components/shared/PlaceholderImage/** - Smart image component with loading skeleton, error handling, and entity-specific SVG placeholders (hero, dungeon, skill, generic)

**Additional Files**

9. **messages/en.json** - English translations for UI strings
10. **messages/zh.json** - Simplified Chinese translations
11. **src/app/[locale]/page.tsx** - Basic homepage placeholder

## Key Features Implemented

- Responsive design with mobile hamburger menu and desktop navigation
- Theme switching (light/dark/system) with proper hydration handling
- Locale switching between English and Chinese
- CSS modules for component-scoped styles
- Base UI portal setup for future dialog/popover components
- Placeholder image system with animated loading skeleton
- Sticky header with smooth transitions
- Global styles with CSS custom properties integration

## Next Steps

To continue with the project:

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Test theme switching and locale switching functionality
4. Proceed with **Phase 3: Data Layer** to add game data and TypeScript interfaces

The foundation is now in place with a fully functional responsive layout, theming, and internationalization!
