These notifications are expected - they're all the dev server instances I killed during the debugging process (exit code 137 = SIGKILL). I was iteratively testing different middleware configurations and restarting the server each time to find the issue.

The good news is that we found and fixed the problem! The locale routing is now working correctly.

## Summary

**Phase 2 implementation is complete** and the locale routing issue has been resolved. Here's what was accomplished:

### Files Created (Phase 2)
1. ✓ `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - Root layout with providers
2. ✓ `src/app/globals.css` - Global styles with Base UI portal setup
3. ✓ `src/components/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Theme provider
4. ✓ `src/components/layout/Header/` - Responsive header component
5. ✓ `src/components/layout/Footer/` - Footer component
6. ✓ `src/components/features/ThemeToggle/` - Theme toggle (light/dark/system)
7. ✓ `src/components/features/LocaleSwitch/` - Locale switcher (EN/中)
8. ✓ `src/components/shared/PlaceholderImage/` - Smart image component with fallbacks
9. ✓ `messages/en.json` - English translations
10. ✓ `messages/zh.json` - Chinese translations
11. ✓ `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Homepage
12. ✓ **`src/middleware.ts`** - Moved to correct location (was the bug!)

### The Bug Fix
The middleware file needed to be at **`src/middleware.ts`** (not in the project root) when using the `src/` directory structure.

### Current Working State
- `http://localhost:3000/` → English content (default locale)
- `http://localhost:3000/zh` → Chinese content
- Theme toggling works (light/dark/system)
- Locale switching works
- Responsive design with mobile menu

Ready to proceed with **Phase 3: Data Layer** whenever you'd like!
